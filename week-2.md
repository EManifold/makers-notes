[Day 1](#day-1) | [Day 2](#day-2) | [Day 3](#day-3) | [Day 4](#day-4) | [Day 5](#day-5) | [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge)

## Goals for the week

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Day 1

### Code review

Reasons to review code:
- Improve the code (Refactor, readability)
- Learn (solve problems, spot patterns)

Reasons to do peer review code:
- Improve communication skills
- Part of pair programming
- Learning from eachother

### Process Workshop

My feedback:
Read instructions v carefully - good
Jumped straight into creating code first - could think about starting with tests
Use of online REPL - good
Started working with first test that passed - could think about starting with simplest test and building up in complexity
Jumped straight into quite complicated solution (if statements, loops) - demonstrates confidence fluency in coding, but not TDD process
Used existing tests to test your solution - good
Looked for other methods to refactor code (switch statements) - good
Tested code after introducing new method - good
Refactored to make methods shorter - good
Could think about using your own tests
