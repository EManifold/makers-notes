[Day 1](#day-1) | [Day 2](#day-2) | [Day 3](#day-3) | [Day 4](#day-4) | [Day 5](#day-5)

## Goals for the week

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

## Day 1

Feedback on code review with Andrea - Takeaway Weekend Challenge
- Need to use more doubles in my code (when relevant)
- Focus on testing behaviour rather than state

**Gaps in knowledge to rectify**
- Doubles

**Todo**
- Update readmes

## Day 2

### Domain Modelling Workshop (2)

Learning objectives:
- Define process modelling as a tool to describe and understand a process.
- Use process modelling to further your understanding of HTTP requests and responses.

What is a model?
- Visual representation
- Oversight of how things work
- Detailing relationships between systems and objects

Three things in a readme:

## Day 3

### Debugging Workshop

Learning Objectives:
- Define 'debugging' as the process of eliminating bugs from an expected program output
- Explain the mantra 'Tighten the loop; Get visibility'
- Use the mantra to resolve bugs across the web stack.

What is debugging? 
- Correcting unexpected behaviour
-- Bug

Process:
1. Tightening the loop -> Right file and line number
2. Get visibility - using p
- If you make a change and the tests still don't pass, then revert that change and try again. Don't just keep changing things in the section. 

Spend 5-10 mins googling status codes
