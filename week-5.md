### Javascript Q&A
- ES6 stands for Ecma Script 6
- Use ES5 class structure or ES6 class structure, but don't interchange in the same project.

## Day 4

### Workshop: Following the flow and getting visibility in JavaScript

Why do we need visibility?
- Need visibility to debug
- Intuitively reason about what's happening in the program
- Even if we're not trying to debug, can just be a good way to increase knowledge of how a piece of software is working

- Useful to console.log arguments to your functions (sometimes there are arguments that we aren't seeing)
- Arity = number of arguments a method takes
- Don't have to even log the actual value you're trying to get visibility for, but can console log a random string to see what's being executed (e.g. in an if/else statement)
- Add a ``` debugger ``` line to your program (inbuilt)
- Console log the value of this at different parts of your code
- Can use a linter to go through your code (for semi-colons)
