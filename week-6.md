## Goals for the week


## Day 1

Bowling Game Kata - Uncle Bob  

### Plans for our group project
- Stand up every morning, 9:30 - setting goals for the day, talking about any possible blockers for the day, what do we expect from the day, where we’re all at with our individual sections
- Retro at the end of the day around 5/5:30 (means we can go back and work afterwards if needed) - discussing what we’ve done each day and how well we’ve achieved the goals that were set in the stand up
- Midday reflection each day
- Pairing as we’re at a team of 6 - starting with pairing with the same people all week, and if this doesn’t work we can be flexible and change to either switching pairs daily or working individually
- Before we start the project, break the project down and think about what each pair is going to be doing. Allocating a section to each pair, making sure we have a solid structure
- Communicate, make sure if you have any problems vocalise them
- Will discuss preferences, what each pair would like to do within the project
- Any possible blockers, not being able to progress on certain parts of the project. If a pair isn’t able to move on, discuss how we will go about rectifying this
- Make sure we’re really strict with the stand ups and retros
- JavaScript for front-end and NodeJS for back-end
